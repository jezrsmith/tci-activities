Repo for sample tci activities and connectors

LIVEAPPS sample:

To install, download code and zip up the LIVEAPPS directory like this:

MacBook-Pro-5:src jsmith$ pwd
/Users/jsmith/go/src

MacBook-Pro-5:src jsmith$ zip -r la.zip ./LIVEAPPS

updating: LIVEAPPS/ (stored 0%)
updating: LIVEAPPS/.DS_Store (deflated 93%)
updating: LIVEAPPS/activity/ (stored 0%)
updating: LIVEAPPS/activity/.DS_Store (deflated 83%)
updating: LIVEAPPS/activity/createComplaint/ (stored 0%)
updating: LIVEAPPS/activity/createComplaint/.DS_Store (deflated 97%)
updating: LIVEAPPS/activity/createComplaint/activity.go (deflated 71%)
updating: LIVEAPPS/activity/createComplaint/activity.json (deflated 73%)

updating: LIVEAPPS/activity/createComplaint/activity.ts (deflated 64%)
updating: LIVEAPPS/activity/createComplaint/activity_test.go (deflated 59%)
updating: LIVEAPPS/activity/createComplaint/complaint.png (stored 0%)
updating: LIVEAPPS/connector/ (stored 0%)
updating: LIVEAPPS/connector/.DS_Store (deflated 93%)
updating: LIVEAPPS/connector/liveapps/ (stored 0%)
updating: LIVEAPPS/connector/liveapps/.DS_Store (deflated 97%)
updating: LIVEAPPS/connector/liveapps/connector.json (deflated 70%)

updating: LIVEAPPS/connector/liveapps/connector.ts (deflated 68%)
updating: LIVEAPPS/connector/liveapps/liveapps.png (stored 0%)


Then you can upload the la.zip file as a connector in the extensions tab of TCI UI

Notes:

It requires the createComplaint sample app in live apps.
